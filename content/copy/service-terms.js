**These Service Terms are important so please read them carefully before you use the services on our website. They create a contract between you and us when you click 'Confirm Order'.** 

**These Service terms apply** when you create an account on this website at _www.forhims.co.uk_  (**"Website"**) and use the Website for any of the following (**“Services”**):  

- Requesting and/or obtaining an online physician consultation (**“Consultation”**);
- Requesting and/or obtaining a prescription to purchase any medication available through the Website (**“Prescription”**); 
- Requesting and/or obtaining any prescription medication available through the Website (**“Prescription Product”**); and
- Purchase any other product, other than a Prescription Product, available through the Website (**“Non-Prescription Product”** and, with the Prescription Products, **“Products”**). 

**These Service Terms tell you:** 

1. how we will provide Services to you, 
2. how you and we may change or end the contract created between you and us, 
3. what to do if there is a problem and 
4. other important information. 

**Please read these Service Terms carefully before you agree to them.** If you think that there is a mistake in these terms please contact us to discuss.

**These Service Terms do not cover your purchase of any Consultation or Prescription Product.** The Consultations and Prescription Products are sold by our partner pharmacy Health Counter Limited, company number 06646711 and registered office at 5 Peterwood Park, Peterwood Way, Croydon, CR0 4UQ (**“Pharmacy”**). The Pharmacy’s terms and conditions of sale are set out in the Pharmacy Terms (below) which create a separate contract between you and the Pharmacy regarding your purchase of the Consultations and any Prescription Products.

1. **Who we are, what we do and contacting us**

    1. **We are** Hims UK, Limited, company number 11534245 and with registered address at 4 More London, Riverside, London, United Kingdom, SE1 2AU (**"we", "us"**). 

    2. **We offer** a platform where you can create an user account (**"Account"**) which allows you to:

        - Obtain a Consultation;
        - Purchase, on a monthly subscription basis ("Subscription"), Prescription Products, if any, that have been prescribed to you based on your Consultation; and 
        - Purchase other Non-Prescription Products made available on the Website from time to time. 

    3. **We are a platform provider to help facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Website.** We are neither the buyer nor the seller of the Consultations or the Prescription Products. The Consultations and Prescription Products are sold by Pharmacy on the [Pharmacy Terms](/pharmacy-terms).  

2. **Our Services**

    1. **Through the Website, you can contract with us for the Services made available by us on the Website.** However, as discussed in these Service Terms, your contract for the Consultations and the Prescription Products you subscribe to through the Services will be with Pharmacy rather than with us.

    2. We are under a legal duty to provide Services that conform to their description on the Website and these Service Terms.

    3. **We rely on you providing accurate information in order to provide the Services, so please ensure you answer our questions accurately.** The Services are designed to help you access Consultations and, if prescribed by the physician, to buy the Prescription Products through a Subscription. To do this, we will ask questions about your health and current medication. Your answers are reviewed by an United Kingdom General Medical Council Licensed Physician to determine whether it is safe to prescribe the Prescription Product to you. It is important you provide accurate responses to these questions, as you would to your doctor. In some cases, you may also need to answer additional questions to allow them to make this assessment, and we will contact you accordingly.

    4. **To be able to access the Services you must first create an Account with us.** You can register for and use the Services through our Website provided that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and a resident of the UK, but for safety reasons, you will only be able to purchase Prescription Products if you are between the ages of 18 and 65. You must provide all details that we request during the sign up process, including valid contact details and a valid payment method as permitted on the Website. 

    5. **Our website is solely for the promotion of our Services and the Products in the UK.** Unfortunately, we do not accept orders from or deliver to addresses outside the UK.

3. **Ordering**

    1. When you submit an order request for a Consultation and/or any Product (by clicking on the **"Confirm Order"** button), Company will send you an email with a reference number to confirm receipt of your order. The reference number will also be visible when you log in to your Account. It will help us if you can tell us this reference number whenever you contact us about your order.

    2. **When you receive a reference number, you have entered a contract with us for the Services and any Non-Prescription Products on these Service Terms, and you have also entered a contract with Pharmacy for the Consultation on the Pharmacy Terms. You have not entered into a contract for any Subscription for Prescription Products at this stage.** You only have a contract with Pharmacy for a Subscription if and when your physician approves a Prescription and we send you a further email stating that your physician has issued a Prescription for a Prescription Product. Note that when you click **“Confirm Order”**, payment is taken for your full order, including any requested Subscription, but if you are not approved for a Prescription Product, your payment, less any charged Consultation fee, will be refunded to you. 

    3. **The contract formed on entering into a Subscription for Prescription Products is solely between Pharmacy and you.** When you order a Consultation and/or a Subscription on the Website, you agree to the [Pharmacy Terms](/pharmacy-terms) are directly between you and Pharmacy. We are not a party to this contract and do not have any responsibility arising out of or in connection with it. We are not an agent for Pharmacy. Pharmacy is responsible to you for the sale and delivery of the Consultations and Prescription Products and for dealing with any claims or any other issues with the Consultations or Prescription Products.

    4. When we contact you, we will do so by telephone (including SMS) or by writing to your email address or postal address using the contact details provided in your Order. You must keep your contact details up-to-date in your Account so that Company can contact you about your order as necessary.


4. **Your Subscription, cancelling and renewing** 

    1. Your Subscription will continue on a month to month basis until you cancel it. We will take payment using the payment details in your Account on the same date each month, starting from the date that your Prescription is issued.

    2. You may cancel or pause your Subscription at any time during your Subscription. If you cancel or pause your membership within 72 hours of your monthly billing date, we will still take payment for your next month's Subscription. Your Subscription shall continue until the end of that month before being cancelled or paused.

    3. Subscriptions for Sildenafil may be paused for one month intervals (Subscriptions for other Prescription Products may not be paused).  If you choose to pause your Subscription for Sildenafil, all deliveries of Sildenafil will be suspended for a one-month period. At the end of this period your Subscription will automatically be un-paused and all deliveries of Sildenafil will resume unless you pause your Subscription again or cancel. You may cancel your Subscription at any time when it is paused.

    4. If you have cancelled your Subscription, you may not place a new order for the same Prescription Product within the same monthly Subscription period and must wait until the next monthly billing date has passed. 

    5. From time to time we may contact you to verify that the information we have on file about your health and medication is still current and accurate and to ask you to notify us of any changes where it isn't. In order to keep your Subscription active you must respond to any such request within the time period set out in the request.

    6. In order to keep your Subscription active and continue to receive Prescription Products, you must renew your Prescription every six months from the date of the Prescription. To renew your Prescription, you must log into your Account and complete a new Consultation. You will receive an email notifying you when you need to renew your Prescription.  

    7. You can also find specific details of your Subscriptions by logging in to your Account.

    8. We may terminate or pause your Subscription if:

        1. You have not renewed your Prescription in accordance with these Service Terms within six months of the when your Prescription was issued;

        2. Your payment details or contact details are out of date/expired;

        3. You have not confirmed that the information we have on file about your health and medication is still accurate (or updated your details if there has been a change) within the requested time period;

        4. Your Account has been terminated or suspended (as set out below);

        5. The requested Prescription Product is unavailable/out of stock;

        6. We cannot authorise your payment for any reason; or

        7. There has been a mistake on the pricing or the description of the Services.
