Hims UK, Limited (**"Hims", "we"** or **"us"**) respects the privacy of individuals. We are a "controller" for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (**"GDPR"**), the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (EU) 2003/2426 (collectively referred to as the **"Data Protection Laws"**). 

This privacy policy contains important information about the following:
- the type of information about you that we collect
- how that information is used
- who will have access to that information
- how long we will hold your personal information for
- our security measures for protection of that information
- how our processing of your personal data is lawful, and 
- your rights under the Data Protection Laws.

The term **"personal data"** means any information from which a living individual can be identified such as name, contact details and photographs. **"Special categories of personal data"** relates to more sensitive types of personal data including (amongst others) racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health or condition and sexual life. These terms are defined in the Data Protection Laws.

#### Categories of information collected 

We will collect and hold these categories of personal data about you: 

- **General enquiries or complaints:** If you submit a general enquiry, or if you need to make a complaint, we will need to collect your:
    - name
    - contact details (address, phone number, email address), and
    - the details of your enquiry or complaint.

- **Account details:** We collect the following information in order to create and maintain your account and enable the medical services provided to you:  
    - your first and last names
    - your email address, username and password 
    - your date of birth 
    - your phone number
    - your marketing preferences.

- **Medical information:** In order to assess whether you can be prescribed with the product you have requested, you need to complete our medical questionnaire which collects medical information about you. This is a special category of personal data and may include photographs that you submit in connection with your medical consultation. 

- **Purchase of prescription products:** We will collect the following information to administer any purchases you wish to make from us:  
    - your contact and delivery details (phone number, email address and postal address)
    - your purchase information (product, date, amount)
    - The prescription issued by a GP. The GP who assesses your medical information will decide if you can be safely prescribed the product you want.

- **Payment information:** We do not store your payment card details within your account as all payment is dealt with directly by Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd. Stripe notifies us whether a transaction is successful or not.

    - name

We also aim to ensure that the level of security and the measures adopted to protect your personal data are appropriate for the risks presented by the nature and use of your personal data. We do this by following recognised industry practices for protecting our IT environment and physical facilities: for example, we encrypt the transmission of information through the website and app by using secure socket layer (SSL) technology and utilise AWS and Aptible to provide ISO 27001, and SOC2 compliance for the personal data that we store on your behalf. 

To help maintain the security of your personal information, We ask that you please notify us immediately of any unauthorised visit, access or use of the website or the loss or unauthorised use of your username or password using the contact information that appears below.

#### Your privacy rights under the Data Protection Laws

You have the following rights under the Data Protection Laws. We will respond to any rights that you exercise within a month of receiving your request, unless the request is particularly complex, in which case we will respond within three months. Please be aware that there are exemptions in relation to some of these rights which we will apply in accordance with the Data Protection Laws. 

1. **Right to access your personal data:** You may ask to see what personal data we hold about you and be provided with:
    - a copy
    - details of the purpose for which it is being or is to be processed 
    - details of the recipients or classes of recipients to whom it is or may be disclosed, including if they are overseas and what protections are used for those oversea transfers 
    - the period for which it is held (or the criteria we use to determine how long it is held) 
    - any information available about the source of that data, and
    - whether we carry out an automated decision-making, or profiling, and where we do information about the logic involved and the envisaged outcome or consequences of that decision or profiling.
To help us find the information easily, please provide us as much information as possible about the type of information you would like to see.

2. **Right to rectification:** You can require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold free of charge. If you would like to do this, please let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with. 

3. **Right to erasure (‘the right to be forgotten’):** You can ask us to erase your personal data where:
    - you do not believe that we need your data in order to process it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy;
    - if you had given us consent to process your data, you withdraw that consent and we cannot otherwise legally process your data; 
    - you object to our processing and we do not have any legitimate interests to process your personal data; or
    - your personal data has been processed unlawfully or have not been erased when it should have been.

4. **Right to withdraw consent:** For the uses of data specified in this Privacy Policy, you have the right to withdraw consent you have given us at any point. This is a vital and necessary aspect of consent. To withdraw your consent, you can contact us at the details in the 'Contact Us' section. Note that any processing carried out prior to the date of withdrawal of your consent will still be valid and any published personal data cannot be retracted.

5. **Right to restrict processing:** You may request that we stop processing your personal data temporarily if: 
    - you do not think that your data is accurate. We will start processing again once we have checked whether or not it is accurate;
    - the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your data; or
    - we no longer need the personal data for our processing, but you need the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

6. **Right to data portability:** You may ask for an electronic copy of your personal data which you provide to us, which we hold electronically and which we process when we have entered into a contract with you. You can also ask us to provide this directly to another party. 

7. **Right to object to processing of your personal data:** You may object to us processing your personal data where we rely on a legitimate interest as our lawful basis for processing. If you object to us processing your personal data we must demonstrate compelling grounds for continuing to do so. We believe we have demonstrated compelling grounds in the section 'Lawful basis for processing your personal data'.

8. **Rights in relation to automated decision making:** We do not make any automated decisions about you so this right does not apply.

If your rights under the Data Protection Laws are breached, you may be entitled to compensation for damage caused by contravention of the Data Protection Laws.

It is important that you ensure you have read this Privacy Policy - and if you do not think that we have processed your data in accordance with this notice - you should let us know as soon as possible.
