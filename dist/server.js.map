The Pharmacy’s terms and conditions of sale are set out in the Pharmacy Terms (below) which create a separate contract between you and the Pharmacy regarding your purchase of the Consultations and any Prescription Products.\r\n\r\n1. **Who we are, what we do and contacting us**\r\n\r\n    1. **We are** Hims UK, Limited, company number 11534245 and with registered address at 4 More London, Riverside, London, United Kingdom, SE1 2AU (**\"we\", \"us\"**). \r\n\r\n    2. **We offer** a platform where you can create an user account (**\"Account\"**) which allows you to:\r\n\r\n        - Obtain a Consultation;\r\n        - Purchase, on a monthly subscription basis (\"Subscription\"), Prescription Products, if any, that have been prescribed to you based on your Consultation; and \r\n        - Purchase other Non-Prescription Products made available on the Website from time to time. \r\n\r\n    3. **We are a platform provider to help facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Website.** We are neither the buyer nor the seller of the Consultations or the Prescription Products. The Consultations and Prescription Products are sold by Pharmacy on the [Pharmacy Terms](/pharmacy-terms).  \r\n\r\n2. **Our Services**\r\n\r\n    1. **Through the Website, you can contract with us for the Services made available by us on the Website.** However, as discussed in these Service Terms, your contract for the Consultations and the Prescription Products you subscribe to through the Services will be with Pharmacy rather than with us.\r\n\r\n    2. We are under a legal duty to provide Services that conform to their description on the Website and these Service Terms.\r\n\r\n    3. **We rely on you providing accurate information in order to provide the Services, so please ensure you answer our questions accurately.** The Services are designed to help you access Consultations and, if prescribed by the physician, to buy the Prescription Products through a Subscription. To do this, we will ask questions about your health and current medication. Your answers are reviewed by an United Kingdom General Medical Council Licensed Physician to determine whether it is safe to prescribe the Prescription Product to you. It is important you provide accurate responses to these questions, as you would to your doctor. In some cases, you may also need to answer additional questions to allow them to make this assessment, and we will contact you accordingly.\r\n\r\n    4. **To be able to access the Services you must first create an Account with us.** You can register for and use the Services through our Website provided that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and a resident of the UK, but for safety reasons, you will only be able to purchase Prescription Products if you are between the ages of 18 and 65. You must provide all details that we request during the sign up process, including valid contact details and a valid payment method as permitted on the Website. \r\n\r\n    5. **Our website is solely for the promotion of our Services and the Products in the UK.** Unfortunately, we do not accept orders from or deliver to addresses outside the UK.\r\n\r\n3. **Ordering**\r\n\r\n    1. When you submit an order request for a Consultation and/or any Product (by clicking on the **\"Confirm Order\"** button), Company will send you an email with a reference number to confirm receipt of your order. The reference number will also be visible when you log in to your Account. It will help us if you can tell us this reference number whenever you contact us about your order.\r\n\r\n    2. **When you receive a reference number, you have entered a contract with us for the Services and any Non-Prescription Products on these Service Terms, and you have also entered a contract with Pharmacy for the Consultation on the Pharmacy Terms. You have not entered into a contract for any Subscription for Prescription Products at this stage.** You only have a contract with Pharmacy for a Subscription if and when your physician approves a Prescription and we send you a further email stating that your physician has issued a Prescription for a Prescription Product. Note that when you click **“Confirm Order”**, payment is taken for your full order, including any requested Subscription, but if you are not approved for a Prescription Product, your payment, less any charged Consultation fee, will be refunded to you. \r\n\r\n    3. **The contract formed on entering into a Subscription for Prescription Products is solely between Pharmacy and you.** When you order a Consultation and/or a Subscription on the Website, you agree to the [Pharmacy Terms](/pharmacy-terms) are directly between you and Pharmacy.

We will take payment using the payment details in your Account on the same date each month, starting from the date that your Prescription is issued.\r\n\r\n    2. You may cancel or pause your Subscription at any time during your Subscription. If you cancel or pause your membership within 72 hours of your monthly billing date, we will still take payment for your next month's Subscription. Your Subscription shall continue until the end of that month before being cancelled or paused.\r\n\r\n    3. Subscriptions for Sildenafil may be paused for one month intervals (Subscriptions for other Prescription Products may not be paused).  If you choose to pause your Subscription for Sildenafil, all deliveries of Sildenafil will be suspended for a one-month period. At the end of this period your Subscription will automatically be un-paused and all deliveries of Sildenafil will resume unless you pause your Subscription again or cancel. You may cancel your Subscription at any time when it is paused.\r\n\r\n    4. If you have cancelled your Subscription, you may not place a new order for the same Prescription Product within the same monthly Subscription period and must wait until the next monthly billing date has passed. \r\n\r\n    5.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.\r\n\r\n **What is Finasteride?**\r\n\r\n Finasteride is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia).\r\n\r\n It is not known if Finasteride works for a receding hairline on either side of and above your forehead (temporal area).\r\n\r\n **Finasteride is not for use by women and children.**\r\n\r\n **Who should not take Finasteride?**\r\n\r\n **Do not take Finasteride if you:**\r\n\r\n - are pregnant or may become pregnant. Finasteride may harm your unborn baby.\r\n  - Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the medicine during handling, as long as the tablets are not broken or crushed. Females who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should not come in contact with broken or crushed Finasteride tablets.\r\n  - If a pregnant woman comes in contact with crushed or broken Finasteride tablets, wash the contact area right away with soap and water. If a woman who is pregnant comes into contact with the active ingredient in Finasteride, a healthcare provider should be consulted. If a woman who is pregnant with a male baby swallows or comes in contact with the medicine in Finasteride, the male baby may be born with sex organs that are not normal.\r\n - are allergic to any of the ingredients in Finasteride. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in Finasteride.\r\n\r\n **What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking Finasteride?

Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.\r\n\r\n **How should I take Finasteride?**\r\n\r\n - Take Finasteride exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it.\r\n - You may take Finasteride with or without food.\r\n - If you forget to take Finasteride, do not take an extra tablet. Just take the next tablet as usual.\r\n\r\n Finasteride will not work faster or better if you take it more than once a day.\r\n\r\n **What are the possible side effects of Finasteride?**\r\n\r\n - **decrease in your blood Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels.** Finasteride can affect a blood test called PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) for the screening of prostate cancer. If you have a PSA test done you should tell your healthcare provider that you are taking Finasteride because Finasteride decreases PSA levels. Changes in PSA levels will need to be evaluated by your healthcare provider. Any increase in follow-up PSA levels from their lowest point may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if the test results are still within the normal range for men not taking Finasteride. You should also tell your healthcare provider if you have not been taking Finasteride as prescribed because this may affect the PSA test results. For more information, talk to your healthcare provider.\r\n\r\n - There may be an increased risk of a more serious form of prostate cancer in men taking finasteride at 5 times the dose of Finasteride.\r\n\r\n The most common side effects of Finasteride include:\r\n\r\n - decrease in sex drive\r\n - trouble getting or keeping an erection\r\n - a decrease in the amount of semen\r\n\r\n The following have been reported in general use with Finasteride:\r\n\r\n - breast tenderness and enlargement.

Beta-blockers affect the heart, lungs and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Propranolol is used to treat tremors, angina (chest pain), hypertension (high blood pressure), heart rhythm disorders, and other heart or circulatory conditions. It is also used to treat or prevent heart attack, and to reduce the severity and frequency of migraine headaches.\r\n\r\nDoctors may prescribe propranolol to control some of the more physical signs of so called performance anxiety. For example, mild shaking or tremor, racing heartbeat and sweating. The more you have these symptoms, the more anxious you may feel.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF PROPRANOLOL?\r\n\r\nGet emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.\r\n\r\nConsult your doctor at once if you have:\r\n\r\nslow or uneven heartbeats;\r\na light-headed feeling, like you might pass out;\r\nwheezing or trouble breathing;\r\nshortness of breath (even with mild exertion), swelling, rapid weight gain;\r\nsudden weakness, vision problems, or loss of coordination (especially in a child with hemangioma that affects the face or head);\r\ncold feeling in your hands and feet;\r\ndepression, confusion, hallucinations;\r\nliver problems--nausea, upper stomach pain, itching, tired feeling, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes);\r\nlow blood sugar--headache, hunger, weakness, sweating, confusion, irritability, dizziness, fast heart rate, or feeling jittery;\r\nlow blood sugar in a baby--pale skin, blue or purple skin, sweating, fussiness, crying, not wanting to eat, feeling cold, - drowsiness, weak or shallow breathing (breathing may stop for short periods), seizure (convulsions), or loss of consciousness; or\r\nsevere skin reaction--fever, sore throat, swelling in your face or tongue, burning in your eyes, skin pain, followed by a red or purple skin rash that spreads (especially in the face or upper body) and causes blistering and peeling.\r\nCommon side effects may include:\r\n\r\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomach cramps;\r\ndecreased sex drive, impotence, or difficulty having an orgasm;\r\nsleep problems (insomnia); or\r\ntired feeling.\r\nThis is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.

Typically, you would start acyclovir within 1 day of noticing a genital lesion or at the first sign of any prodromal symptoms (tingling, itching, or burning) that precede some outbreaks. This type of therapy can shorten the time to healing of the herpes lesions.\r\nSuppressive Therapy: This is when you take acyclovir on a daily basis. Suppressive therapy is often recommended for people who experience frequent or severe recurrences or those people who would like to reduce the risk of transmission to a sexual partner who does not have genital herpes.\r\n\r\nAciclovir does not cure genital herpes. There is no cure for genital herpes.\r\n\r\nAciclovir used on a daily basis (SUPPRESSIVE THERAPY) with safer sex practices can lower (but not completely eliminate) the chances of passing genital herpes to your partner.\r\n\r\nDo not have sexual contact with your partner when you have any symptom or outbreak of genital herpes.\r\n\r\nUse a condom made of latex or polyurethane whenever you have sexual contact.\r\n\r\nDo not use acyclovir for the treatment of genital herpes if you:\r\n\r\nHave never had the diagnosis of genital herpes made by a healthcare provider in-person\r\nAre hypersensitive to acyclovir, acyclovir, or any component of acyclovir’s formulation\r\nMain Ingredient: Valacyclovir hydrochloride\r\nInactive ingredients: carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, FD&C Blue No. 2 Lake, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, titanium dioxide, edible white ink\r\nIf any of the following conditions apply to you, please speak with a healthcare provider in-person about seeking treatment for your genital herpes:\r\n\r\nYounger than 18 years of age\r\nPregnant or breastfeeding\r\nHIV infection or AIDS\r\nKidney or liver problems\r\nHistory of a bone marrow transplant or kidney transplant\r\nWeakened immune system not related to HIV infection\r\nAseptic encephalitis or transverse myelitis\r\nUrinary retention issues\r\nWidespread herpes simplex virus\r\nHistory of seizure disorder\r\nWhat are some of the more common side effects of valacyclovir?\r\n\r\nYou may experience side effects with this medication.

You are also likely to experience increased viral shedding, even when you don’t have an outbreak. This may increase the risk of infecting a sexual partner with the herpes virus.\r\n\r\nPlease tell your physician if you are currently taking any of the following medicines, as they may have an interaction with valacyclovir. If you are taking any of these medicines, you must see a healthcare provider in-person for treatment of your genital herpes:\r\n\r\nCladribine\r\nClozapine\r\nFoscarnet\r\nMycophenolate\r\nTalimogene laherparepvec\r\nTenofovir Products\r\nTheophylline Derivatives\r\nTizanidine\r\nZidovudine\r\nPlease read the following information regarding the Varicella Virus Vaccine and the Zoster Vaccine:\r\n\r\nVaricella Virus Vaccine: avoid use of acyclovir within the 24 hours prior to administration of the varicella vaccine, and avoid use for 14 days after vaccination.\r\nZoster Vaccine (Live/Attenuated): discontinue acyclovir for at least 24 hours prior to and 14 days after receiving a live attenuated zoster vaccine.\r\n\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst acneImportantSafetyInformation = `\r\n\r\n**Topical Tretinoin : Patient medication information**\r\n\r\n**What do I need to tell my doctor before I apply this medication?**\r\n\r\nIf you have an allergy to Tretinoin or any other part of this drug.\r\nIf you are allergic to any drugs like this one, any other drugs, foods, or other substances.

This Notice applies to {{legalEntity}}, and other entities related to the Bailey Health entities, including their providers and employees, as well as certain Bailey Health vendors and related entities, such as Hims Inc. (“Hims”) (collectively, the “Practice”).\r\n\r\n#### 1. OUR OBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\nWe are required by law to:\r\n\r\n- Maintain the privacy of your medical information, to the extent required by state and federal law;\r\n- Give you this Notice explaining our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you;\r\n- Notify affected individuals following a breach of unsecured medical information under federal law; and\r\n- Follow the terms of the version of this Notice that is currently in effect.\r\n\r\n#### 2. HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU\r\n\r\nThe following categories describe the different ways that we typically use and disclose medical information, the purposes for such uses and disclosures, and the reasons for such uses and disclosures.\r\n\r\nAs noted below, we may contact you via different methods that you may approve, such as via text message, email, or thorough your Bailey Health or Hims account. In most instances, your initial communication with the Practice will be through an interaction with the Practice on the Bailey Health website or app, which communication may include the completion by you of a questionnaire or other asynchronous communication with the Practice, and the subsequent communication back to you by the Practice of further medical information.\r\n\r\nSpecifically speaking, the Practice may communicate with you in the following specific ways and for the following specific purposes:\r\n\r\nType & Purpose\r\n\r\n- Email communications; To provide you with information on special offers and deals\r\n- Customer Service Emails, texts, or app notifications; To provide you with updates on problems with orders, late shipments, and other questions applicable to your doctor’s visit(s)\r\n- Tracking emails; To notify you when prescriptions have been shipped, will arrive, and other confirmations\r\n- Order information; To provide information on content of orders (additional products or samples)\r\n- Follow-up texts; To allow a doctor or nurse to contact you with changes to your course of treatment\r\n- Referral programs; To provide you with information on benefits you may receive if you refer another patient to the Practice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Practice may use and disclose your medical information for the following reasons. These categories are intended to be general descriptions only, and not a list of every instance in which we may use or disclose your medical information. Please understand that for these categories, the law generally does not require us to get your authorization in order for us to use or disclose your medical information.\r\n\r\n- For Treatment.We may use and disclose medical information about you to provide you with health care treatment and related services, including coordinating and managing your health care. We may disclose medical information about you to physicians, nurses, other health care providers and personnel who are providing or involved in providing health care to you (both within and outside of the Practice). For example, should your care require referral to a pharmacy for the provision of prescription drugs, we may provide that pharmacy with your medical information in order to aid the pharmacist in his or her treatment of you.\r\n- For Payment.We may use and disclose medical information about you so that we or may bill and collect from you, an insurance company, or a third party for the health care services we provide. This may also include the disclosure of medical information to obtain prior authorization for treatment and procedures from your insurance plan. For example, we may send a claim for payment to your insurance company, and that claim may have a code on it that describes the services that have been rendered to you. If, however, you pay for an item or service in full, out of pocket and request that we not disclose to your health plan the medical information solely relating to that item or service, as described more fully in Section IV of this Notice, we will follow that restriction on disclosure unless otherwise required by law.\r\n- For Health Care Operations. We may use and disclose medical information about you for our health care operations. These uses and disclosures are necessary to operate and manage our practice and to promote quality care. For example, we may need to use or disclose your medical information in order to assess the quality of care you receive or to conduct certain cost management, business management, administrative, or quality improvement activities or to provide information to our insurance carriers.\r\n- Quality Assurance and Utilization Review. We may need to use or disclose your medical information for our internal processes to assess and facilitate the provision of quality care to our patients. We may need to use or disclose your medical information to perform a review of the services we provide in order to evaluate whether that the appropriate level of services is received, depending on condition and diagnosis.\r\n- Credentialing and Peer Review. We may need to use or disclose your medical information in order for us to review the credentials, qualifications and actions of our health care providers.\r\n- Treatment Alternatives. We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that we believe may be of interest to you.\r\n- Appointment Reminders and Information about Health Related Benefits and Services. We may use and disclose medical information, in order to contact you (including, for example, contacting you by phone and leaving a message on an answering machine) to provide appointment reminders and other information. We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about health-related benefits or services that we believe may be of interest to you. See also the specific types of communications noted above.\r\n- Business Associates. There are some services (such as billing or legal services) that may be provided to or on behalf of our Practice through contracts with business associates, such as Hims, Inc. When these services are contracted, we may disclose your medical information to our business associate so that they can perform the job we have asked them to do. To protect your medical information, however, we require the business associate to appropriately safeguard your information.\r\n- Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care. We may disclose medical information about you to a friend or family member who is involved in your health care, as well as to someone who helps pay for your care, but we will do so only as allowed by state or federal law (with an opportunity for you to agree or object when required under the law), or in accordance with your prior authorization.\r\n- As Required by Law. We will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal, state, or local law or regulations.\r\n- Other. Subject to applicable legal requirements, and where appropriate for your medical care or required by law, we may also use your medical information (i) to avert an imminent threat of injury to health or safety, (ii) for organ donation purposes, for research, (iii) to appropriate military authorities if you are in the armed forces, (iv) for workers’ compensation programs, (v) for public health activities, (vi) for health oversight activities, (vii) for other legal matters, (viii) for law enforcement purposes, (ix) to coroners and medical examiners, or (x) for marketing or fundraising purposes\r\n- Electronic Disclosures of Medical Information. Under the law of certain states, we are required to provide notice to you if your medical information is subject to electronic disclosure. This Notice serves as general notice that we may disclose your medical information electronically for treatment, payment, or health care operations or as otherwise authorized or required by state or federal law.\r\n\r\n#### 3. OTHER USES OF MEDICAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- Authorizations. There are times we may need or want to use or disclose your medical information for reasons other than those listed above, but to do so we will need your prior authorization. Other than expressly provided herein, any other uses or disclosures of your medical information will require your specific written authorization.\r\n- Psychotherapy Notes, Marketing and Sale of Medical Information.Most uses and disclosures of “psychotherapy notes,” uses and disclosures of medical information for marketing purposes, and disclosures that constitute a “sale of medical information” under HIPAA require your authorization. The Practice does not anticipate that it will obtain psychotherapy notes or sale medical information.\r\n- Right to Revoke Authorization. If you provide us with written authorization to use or disclose your medical information for such other purposes, you may revoke that authorization in writing at any time. If you revoke your authorization, we will no longer use or disclose your medical information for the reasons covered by your written authorization. You understand that we are unable to take back any uses or disclosures we have already made in reliance upon your authorization, and that we are required to retain our records of the care that we provided to you.\r\n\r\n#### 4. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU\r\n\r\nFederal and state laws provide you with certain rights regarding the medical information we have about you. The following is a summary of those rights.\r\n\r\n- Right to Inspect and Copy. Under most circumstances, you have the right to inspect and/or copy your medical information that we maintain in our possession in a designated record set, which generally includes your medical and billing records. To inspect or copy your medical information, you must submit your request to do so in writing to the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address listed in Section VI below. If you request a copy of your information, we may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing, or certain supplies associated with your request. The fee we may charge will be the amount allowed by state law. If your requested medical information is maintained in an electronic format (e.g., as part of an electronic medical record, electronic billing record, or other group of records maintained by the Practice that is used to make decisions about you) and you request an electronic copy of this information, then we will provide you with the requested medical information in the electronic form and format requested, if it is readily producible in that form and format. If it is not readily producible in the requested electronic form and format, we will provide access in a readable electronic form and format as agreed to by the Practice and you. In certain very limited circumstances allowed by law, we may deny your request to review or copy your medical information. We will give you any such denial in writing. If you are denied access to medical information, you may request that the denial be reviewed. Another licensed health care professional chosen by the Practice will review your request and the denial. The person conducting the review will not be the person who denied your request. We will abide by the outcome of the review.\r\n- Right to Amend. If you feel the medical information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the information. You have the right to request an amendment for as long as the information is kept by the Practice. To request an amendment, your request must be in writing and submitted to the HIPAA Officer at the address listed in Section VI below. In your request, you must provide a reason as to why you want this amendment. If we accept your request, we will notify you of that in writing. We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request. In addition, we may deny your request if you ask us to amend information that (i) was not created by us (unless you provide a reasonable basis for asserting that the person or organization that created the information is no longer available to act on the requested amendment), (ii) is not part of the information kept by the Practice, (iii) is not part of the information which you would be permitted to inspect and copy, or (iv) is accurate and complete. If we deny your request, we will notify you of that denial in writing.\r\n- Right to an Accounting of Disclosures. You have the right to request an \"accounting of disclosures\" of your medical information. This is a list of the disclosures we have made for up to six years prior to the date of your request of your medical information, but may not include disclosures for Treatment, Payment, or Health Care Operations (as described in Sections II A, B, and C of this Notice) or disclosures made pursuant to your specific authorization (as described in Section III of this Notice), or certain other disclosures. If we make disclosures through an electronic health records (EHR) system, you may have an additional right to an accounting of disclosures for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations. Please contact the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address set forth in Section VI below for more information regarding whether we have implemented an EHR and the effective date, if any, of any additional right to an accounting of disclosures made through an EHR for the purposes of Treatment, Payment, or Health Care Operations. To request a list of accounting, you must submit your request in writing to the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address set forth in Section VI below. Your request must state a time period, which may not be longer than six years (or longer than three years for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations disclosures made through an EHR, if applicable). Your request should indicate in what form you want the list (for example, on paper or electronically). The first list you request within a twelve-month period will be free. For additional lists, we may charge you a reasonable fee for the costs of providing the list. We will notify you of the cost involved and you may choose to withdraw or modify your request at that time before any costs are incurred.\r\n- Right to Request Restrictions. You have the right to request a restriction or limitation on the medical information we use or disclose about you for treatment, payment, or health care operations. You also have the right to request a restriction or limitation on the medical information we disclose about you to someone who is involved in your care or the payment for your care, like a family member or friend. Except as specifically described below in this Notice, we are not required to agree to your request for a restriction or limitation. If we do agree, we will comply with your request unless the information is needed to provide emergency treatment. In addition, there are certain situations where we won’t be able to agree to your request, such as when we are required by law to use or disclose your medical information. To request restrictions, you must make your request in writing to the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address listed in Section VI of this Notice below. In your request, you must specifically tell us what information you want to limit, whether you want us to limit our use, disclosure, or both, and to whom you want the limits to apply. As stated above, in most instances we do not have to agree to your request for restrictions on disclosures that are otherwise allowed. However, if you pay or another person (other than a health plan) pays on your behalf for an item or service in full, out of pocket, and you request that we not disclose the medical information relating solely to that item or service to a health plan for the purposes of payment or health care operations, then we will be obligated to abide by that request for restriction unless the disclosure is otherwise required by law. You should be aware that such restrictions may have unintended consequences, particularly if other providers need to know that information (such as a pharmacy filling a prescription). It will be your obligation to notify any such other providers of this restriction. Additionally, such a restriction may impact whether an insurance company wil pay for related care that you may not want to pay for out of pocket (and which would not be subject to the restriction).\r\n- Right to Request Confidential Communications. You have the right to request that we communicate with you about medical matters in a certain way or at a certain location. For example, you can ask that we only contact you at home and not at work or, conversely, only at work and not at home. To request such confidential communications, you must make your request in writing to the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address listed in Section VI below. We will not ask the reason for your request, and we will use our best efforts to accommodate all reasonable requests, but there are some requests with which we will not be able comply. Your request must specify how and where you wish to be contacted.\r\n- Right to an Email or Paper Copy of This Notice. You have the right to a paper copy of this Notice. You may ask us to give you a copy of this Notice at any time. To obtain a copy of this Notice, you must make your request in writing to the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address set forth in Section VI below.\r\n- Right to Breach Notification. In certain instances, we may be obligated to notify you (and potentially other parties) if we become aware that your medical information has been improperly disclosed or otherwise subject to a “breach” as defined in and/or required by HIPAA and applicable state law.\r\n\r\n#### 5. CHANGES TO THIS NOTICE\r\n\r\nWe reserve the right to change this Notice at any time, along with our privacy policies and practices. We reserve the right to make the revised or changed Notice effective for medical information we already have about you as well, as any information we receive in the future. We will post a copy of the current notice, along with an announcement that changes have been made, as applicable, on our website and in any physical office in which the Practice practices medicine. When changes have been made to the Notice, you may obtain a revised copy by sending a letter to the Practice’s HIPAA Officer at the address listed in Section VI below.\r\n\r\n#### 6.
