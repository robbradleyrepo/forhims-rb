## Setup environment

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

TODO

## Development (Staging API)
This command starts the Node server (`npm start`) and Webpack build (`npm run webpack`)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Launching the server from an IDE/Editor
You can initiate the Webpack file watcher & builder process separately if you'd like to take control of the Node server.
This is especially useful when you need to use your IDE/Editor's step debugger utilities.

First, launch the file watcher & builder and leave it running in a separate shell :

```bash
npm run build:local
```

Next step will depend on your editor of choice. Feel free to add yours :
- For Webstorm : You can run/debug a Node instance by using `dist/server.js` as the target Javascript file. Step debugging
will work out of the box as long as Webstorm is able to see the server.js sourcemap file.

You might need to relaunch your server when you make file changes and trigger a Webpack rebuild.
