It is also used to treat or prevent heart attack, and to reduce the severity and frequency of migraine headaches.

Doctors may prescribe propranolol to control some of the more physical signs of so called performance anxiety. For example, mild shaking or tremor, racing heartbeat and sweating. The more you have these symptoms, the more anxious you may feel.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF PROPRANOLOL?

const acyclovirImportantSafetyInformation = `

What is the most important information that I should know about acyclovir for the treatment of genital herpes?

Aciclovir can be used as an Episodic Therapy or a Suppressive Therapy for the treatment of genital herpes:

Episodic Therapy: This is when you take acyclovir for an individual outbreak as it occurs. Typically, you would start acyclovir within 1 day of noticing a genital lesion or at the first sign of any prodromal symptoms (tingling, itching, or burning) that precede some outbreaks. This type of therapy can shorten the time to healing of the herpes lesions.
Suppressive Therapy: This is when you take acyclovir on a daily basis. Suppressive therapy is often recommended for people who experience frequent or severe recurrences or those people who would like to reduce the risk of transmission to a sexual partner who does not have genital herpes.

Aciclovir does not cure genital herpes. There is no cure for genital herpes.

Aciclovir used on a daily basis (SUPPRESSIVE THERAPY) with safer sex practices can lower (but not completely eliminate) the chances of passing genital herpes to your partner.

Do not have sexual contact with your partner when you have any symptom or outbreak of genital herpes.

Use a condom made of latex or polyurethane whenever you have sexual contact.

Do not use acyclovir for the treatment of genital herpes if you:

Have never had the diagnosis of genital herpes made by a healthcare provider in-person
Are hypersensitive to acyclovir, acyclovir, or any component of acyclovir’s formulation
Main Ingredient: Valacyclovir hydrochloride
Inactive ingredients: carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, FD&C Blue No. 2 Lake, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, titanium dioxide, edible white ink
If any of the following conditions apply to you, please speak with a healthcare provider in-person about seeking treatment for your genital herpes:

Younger than 18 years of age
Pregnant or breastfeeding
HIV infection or AIDS
Kidney or liver problems
History of a bone marrow transplant or kidney transplant
Weakened immune system not related to HIV infection
Aseptic encephalitis or transverse myelitis
Urinary retention issues
Widespread herpes simplex virus
History of seizure disorder
What are some of the more common side effects of valacyclovir?

You may experience side effects with this medication. These side effects are common and typically go away with time and regular use:

Headache
Nausea
Stomach Pain
Vomiting
Dizziness
Side effects in HIV-infected adults may also include:

Tiredness
Rash
What are the less common but concerning side effects that I should contact a healthcare provider immediately for?

Any sign of an allergic reaction
Changes in mood or in the way that you are acting
Feeling confused
Difficulty speaking
Feeling shaky, having difficulty moving, or feeling stiff
Seizures
Bruising or bleeding, dark urine, yellowing of the skin or eyes
Severe weakness or fatigue
Difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine
Hallucinations
What will happen once I stop using valacyclovir for suppression of genital herpes?

Once this treatment is stopped, you may experience genital herpes outbreaks at the same frequency that you did prior to using valacyclovir for suppression. You are also likely to experience increased viral shedding, even when you don’t have an outbreak. This may increase the risk of infecting a sexual partner with the herpes virus.

Please tell your physician if you are currently taking any of the following medicines, as they may have an interaction with valacyclovir. If you are taking any of these medicines, you must see a healthcare provider in-person for treatment of your genital herpes:

Cladribine
Clozapine
Foscarnet
Mycophenolate
Talimogene laherparepvec
Tenofovir Products
Theophylline Derivatives
Tizanidine
Zidovudine
Please read the following information regarding the Varicella Virus Vaccine and the Zoster Vaccine:

Varicella Virus Vaccine: avoid use of acyclovir within the 24 hours prior to administration of the varicella vaccine, and avoid use for 14 days after vaccination.
Zoster Vaccine (Live/Attenuated): discontinue acyclovir for at least 24 hours prior to and 14 days after receiving a live attenuated zoster vaccine.
