        'From your responses it appears that a principal concern is premature ejaculation. This is defined as ejaculation within the first 30 seconds to one minute of intercourse, or ejaculation occurring sooner than the patient or their partner is satisfied with. \n\nFor this condition the first line of management is the following:\n1) Modify your sexual techniques to improve "latency" or time to ejaculation. One option includes stopping intercourse and withdrawing the penis when the sensation to ejaculate comes on-- and then resuming when the sensation subsides, and possibly also squeezing the head of the penis firmly to assist in preventing ejaculation.\n2) Use an over the counter topical anesthetic product such as lubricant with numbing medication (lidocaine) inside of a condom.\n\nShould these measures not resolve your symptoms, you may need to see your PCP to discuss starting a medication (currently HIMS is unable to prescribe this medication) called an SSRI to help.',

This is defined as ejaculation within the first 30 seconds to one minute of intercourse, or ejaculation occurring sooner than the patient or their partner is satisfied with. \n\nFor this condition the first line of management is the following:\n1) Modify your sexual techniques to improve "latency" or time to ejaculation. One option includes stopping intercourse and withdrawing the penis when the sensation to ejaculate comes on-- and then resuming when the sensation subsides, and possibly also squeezing the head of the penis firmly to assist in preventing ejaculation.\n2) Use an over the counter topical anesthetic product such as lubricant with numbing medication (lidocaine) inside of a condom.\n\nShould these measures not resolve your symptoms, you may need to see your PCP to discuss starting a medication (currently HIMS is unable to prescribe this medication) called an SSRI to help.',
